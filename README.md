### Programming via UART

ESP32 modules can be programmed using USB-UART adapter connected to the corresponding UART pins on the ESP32 module. This approach allows to save space on PCB boards, which is very helpful when PCB dimentions have constraints.

## Unified Configuration Framework

ESP Nodes performing specific operations can use different ESP32 Modules for optimization purposes. As dicersity of ESP32s being used by the Nodes increases, so does the code. However, in order to keep core code independent from the ESP32 Module being used, the so-called configurations specific for the particular ESP32 Module are defined in config.h file.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Remember to add entry for congif.h inside .gitignore file to prevent Git from pushing security sensitive data to the repository.

Bare-bones ESP32 module can be programmed via UART interface (`GPIO03` and `GPIO01`) using USB to UART adapter.

## Temperature Node. The Key Elements and Components

The **Temperature Node** broadcasts the air temperature, atmospheric pressure and air humidity over secured MQTT.

### I2C Air Temperature Thermostat (LM75A)

The LM75A is an industry-standard digital temperature sensor. The LM75A provides 9-bit digital temperature readings with an accuracy of ±2°C from –25°C to 100°C
and ±3°C over –55°C to 125°C. The LM75A operates with a single supply from +2.7 V to +5.5 V. Communication is accomplished over a 2-wire interface which operates up to 400kHz.
The LM75A has three address pins, allowing up to eight LM75A devices to operate on the same 2-wire bus. The LM75A has a dedicated over-temperature output (O.S.) with
programmable limit and hysteresis. This output has programmable fault tolerance, which allows the user to
define the number of consecutive error conditions that must occur before O.S. is activated.

### I2C Air Temperature, Pressure and Humidity Sensor Board (BME280)

BME280 is combined temperature, humidity and pressure sensor. The unit combines high linearity and high accuracy sensors and is perfectly feasible for low current consumption, long-term stability and high EMC robustness. The humidity sensor offers an extremely fast response time and therefore supports performance requirements for emerging applications such as context awareness, and high accuracy over a wide temperature range.[^2]

Below is the functional diagram of BME-/BMP-280. Notable difference between the two devices, is that BME-280 is capable of measuring relative humidity. BME-280 has square shape, while BMP-280 has rectangular shape.

<img alt="ESP32-Node Pinout" src="https://github.com/alexandrebobkov/ESP-Nodes/blob/main/assets/bme280_functional-diagram.png" width="400px"/>

BME-280 can come in a ready-to-use PCB ...

<img alt="ESP32-Node Pinout" src="https://github.com/alexandrebobkov/ESP-Nodes/blob/main/assets/BME280.jpg" width="200px"/>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> BM**E**280[^2] and BM**P**280[^3] look almost identical. However, BME280 sensor has a square form, while BMP280 has a rectangular form. In addition, the two sensor boards can have different I<sup>2</sup>C addresses.

**4-pin variant**

The BME280 sensor board interface uses 4 pins and is 13mm by 10.5mm in size. The four pins are `VIN`, `GND`, `SCL` and `SDA`. The measured values are sent via I<sup>2</sup>C protocol. The I<sup>2</sup>C slave address is pre-defined and can take value either 0x76 or 0x77 (BME280 Datasheet, page 32)[^4].

### Wiring

| Pin | ESP32 GPIO |
| --- | --- |
| `SCL` | `GPIO22` |
| `SDA ` | `GPIO21` |

### Reading Values

```C
i2c_master_write_read_device(I2C_MASTER_NUM, 0x76, &reg_addr, 1, data, len, I2C_MASTER_TIMEOUT_MS / portTICK_PERIOD_MS);
```

<p>Data readout is done by starting a burst read from 0xF7 to 0xFC (temperature and pressure) or from 0xF7 to 0xFE (temperature, pressure, and humidity). The data are rad out in an unsigned 20-bit format both for pressure and for temperature, and in an unsigned 26-bit format for humidity. After the uncompensated values for pressure, temperature, and humidity have been read, the actual humidity, pressure and temperature needs to be calculated using the compensation parameters stored in the device.</p>
